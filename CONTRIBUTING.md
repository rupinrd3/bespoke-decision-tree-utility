- **Export**: PMML, JSON serialization

## üìè Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

```python
# Use descriptive variable names
def calculate_node_statistics(node_data, target_variable):
    """Calculate comprehensive statistics for a tree node.
    
    Args:
        node_data: DataFrame containing node records
        target_variable: Name of the target column
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary containing calculated statistics
    """
    pass

# Use type hints where helpful
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def find_optimal_split(data: pd.DataFrame, 
                      target: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, float]]:
    """Find the optimal split for the given data."""
    pass
```

### Code Organization

- **Modularity**: Keep functions and classes focused on single responsibilities
- **Documentation**: Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
- **Error Handling**: Include appropriate try/catch blocks and user-friendly error messages
- **Logging**: Use the existing logging framework for debug information

### UI Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Follow existing UI patterns and styling
- **Accessibility**: Ensure UI elements are keyboard accessible
- **Responsiveness**: Test UI with different window sizes
- **Internationalization**: Use translatable strings where possible

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from models.decision_tree import DecisionTree

class TestDecisionTree:
    def setup_method(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        self.sample_data = create_sample_dataset()
        
    def test_tree_building(self):
        """Test basic tree building functionality."""
        tree = DecisionTree()
        result = tree.build_tree(self.sample_data, target='outcome')
        assert result is not None
        assert tree.get_depth() > 0
```

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **UI Tests**: Test user interface functionality (where applicable)
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure large dataset handling
- **Cross-Platform Tests**: Verify Windows and Ubuntu compatibility
